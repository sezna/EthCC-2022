## A year's progress in Sway, the smart contract language for the FuelVM.

Note:
Last year I gave a talk at this same conference. There, we announced a new open source smart contract development language.
We have been hard at work for a year, and we have more contributors than ever. We work out in the open, so perhaps you
have seen our repositories. 

I'm going to cover the progress we have made since last year's announcement and why exactly you should be learning Sway, or
at the very least, being excited about it.
